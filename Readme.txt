LaTexMathML.js is a open source liburary from https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/drw/lm.html with tiny modification by me to fit the style of my teacher's tex. There are still a lot of defects and may be improved in the future.

usage (test in my chrome 24.0.1312.57m with Windows 8): 
1.install the extension in your chrome browser. (see how to install chrome extensions in http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html). Then there would be an icon right next to the address bar of your browser.
2.open a tex file into your chrome window (url is also ok). 
3.when the tex tab is selected, click the extension icon. then the latex formulas would be transformed to MathML format and colored BLUE in the page. click the formula to get the WORD MATHML formatted formula selected and copy-paste to your Word doc!
